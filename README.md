cedar os wrapper
For the hackathon main track, we want to create a project using Cedar (YC) OS that essentially creates a cedar news copilot solving two main problems. one - when you're reading a news report on some site and are confused about a certain detail or want to learn more about a given topic, you can give a voice command and the AI will access the Perplexity Search API and generate a custom news report related to what you asked for complete with relevant links (emphasis on seamless overlay and React usage for UI). 1a - this isn't a priority feature but if you highlight some text ur unfamiliar about/want more info on and press some command (we need your help coming up with this part), the app will generate a wikipedia-like summary for you. 2 - when youre watching a video about a news topic and you're confused about something, it will give an overlay like a similar summary and generate a description for that. front-end wise: seamless, collapsible, automatically gives you recommendations based on what you're reading/watching rn for future reference.
