# prism ai - your all in one news copilot
(CedarOS wrapper)

good journalism should unite and inform - not confuse and divide. in today's era of limited attention spans, polarizing echo chambers, and fluff news, it's really hard to get what you really want - the raw truth. at prism ai, we make it so that you get news that works for you your way. with multimodal voice-controlled and tactile options available, simply tap prism's microphone and ask it to summarize a news article, explain a concept, or give more context, and it'll generate a customized news report that gives you the results you truly want. 

furthermore, we're working on tactile interfaces where you can highlight a section of text and get the same amazing results - we bring you news, powered your way, with prism - also powered your way. we're even expanding into multimedia, providing context from youtube videos when and where you need it (prism accesses the transcript so you don't have to :))

to use prism, simply open a news article or video of your choice, where it will work as an extension and seamlessly overlay as a dropdown option on your screen, ready to be activated at any time. if you want something explained, simply click on the microphone icon and speak your commands, and it will return a custom report powered by the Perplexity Search API (with relevant links so you can do your own research later). we use cedarOS copilot and its built-in suite of products (mastra agents, multimodal agents, etc) to power our double-sensory features, enabling robust integration of user preferences with quality news.
